IMPORTANT: If you do not care about USB downloads (via the USB cable, not a
flashdrive), you can safely skip the following directions

------------

CBCDownloader requires rxtx for USB downloads. Unfortunately, rxtx is not 100%
Java, nor is there, or will ever be, a 100% Java implementation for serial
communication. Fortunately, installation is somewhat painless.

On Ubuntu (and probably Debian), it is a simple apt command:
    $ sudo apt-get install librxtx-java

On Mac OS X and M$ Windoz, it should be as simple as CDing into this directory
and running:
	$ javaws gnu.io.SafeCommDriver.jnlp
...although that is untested...

If that fails, download the latest stable version from here:
    http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download
and follow the INSTALL file that comes inside of the zip included, skipping the
part where you copy the '.jar' file. That is included with CBCDownloader.
